# Sketches

[Sketches][] are tiny bits of code that you don't normally get to write.
Things that would otherwise be:
* Already taken care of by a framework or library
* Considered poor practice in a professional setting
* Totally useless, despite being interesting

Each folder describes a potential sketch that may or may not be worth
attempting, and also has the output of my own attempt at it. There are
no right or wrong answers though, so long as it at least kind of achieves
what was described. If you attempt a sketch, feel free to skip parts you
don't think are cool, or expand on parts you found particularly interesting.
